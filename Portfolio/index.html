  <h2> <span style="color: blue"><em>About Me</em></span> </h2>

<img src="images/me.jpg"alt="photo of me"style="height:500px; width:300px;"/>


<p> I am a 27 year old female born and raised in Camden, New York. I graduated top of my class and lived an active lifestyle including playing softball, volleyball, the violin, and some basic piano music. After graduating Camden High School, I enrolled as a biology major student at Oswego University. By my second year I realized Biology was not the right career choice, so I withdrew from Oswego and enrolled into a community college in Rochester NY where I received my associates in Health Studies. </p>

<p> My interest in Computer Science started when I bought my first computer. Keyboarding skills came naturally to me as well and I was always clicking around trying to figure out the different systems of the computer and what they did.  I am excited to see where this next year brings me in the Web Developing bootcamp. I hope one day I can be an entrepreneur and showcase my new learned skills. </p>
